You'll need a text file with an ADS API key called "API_KEY.txt" for the script to work, as well as collected_addresses.json

To run the script, you'll need a csv with a list of bibcodes from the ADS, one on each line. The script will ask you the file name, enter it leaving out the file extension. It will then geocode the articles' affiliations into a folder with the same name as the csv you were working on.
